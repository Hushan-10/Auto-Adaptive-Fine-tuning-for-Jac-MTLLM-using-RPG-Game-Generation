# Pattern Validator

A lightweight Python tool to validate **Level** and **Map** JSON records generated by the JAC walker project.  
It checks structure, types, and formatting, and can also detect if the JSON is strictly minified and ordered.

## Features
- Validates two JSON schemas:
  - **LEVEL** → metadata (name, difficulty, time, width, height, num_wall, num_enemies).
  - **MAP** → full map (level + walls + small obstacles + enemies + player position).
- Handles plain JSON, JSONL (one per line), or stringified/double-encoded JSON.
- Reports whether input is:
  - **VALID (LEVEL/MAP)** → with optional strictness check.
  - **INVALID** → with detailed reason.
- Provides a canonical **minified JSON** when structure is valid but formatting differs.

## Output Example

- [1] kind=LEVEL strict=true
- [2] kind=MAP strict=false
  - note: Structurally valid but not minified/ordered exactly.
  - minified:
  -{"level":{...},"walls":[...],"small_obstacles":[...],"enemies":[...],"player_pos":{"x":1,"y":2}}
- [3] kind=INVALID strict=false
  -reason: Map keys mismatch; got ['walls','level']
