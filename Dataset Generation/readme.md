## Dataset Generation

We began by playing the game through API calls using GPT-4, from which we collected around **2,000 samples**. After gathering this data, we analyzed the input–output patterns of level generation.

Based on these observed patterns, we created **Python** and **JAC** scripts capable of producing outputs with the same structure.  
To ensure quality and consistency, we applied two validation steps:

- **Pattern Validator**: Checked that the generated data followed the correct input–output format.  
- **Map Validator**: Filtered and retained only valid maps.  

This approach was necessary because generating a large amount of correct data directly through API calls would have been **very costly** and **time-consuming**. By replicating the pattern locally and validating the results, we were able to build a much larger dataset suitable for **fine-tuning a model efficiently**.


All the Datasets are Created By these python scripts and JAC scripts. 
And map validators are used to identify falulty maps from the datasets generated by Python and JAC Scripts. after validation we did collect 100% Correct , High quality Datasets
