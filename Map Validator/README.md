# Map Validator

A simple Python tool to validate game maps for **reachability** and **enemy count** rules.  
It ensures maps generated by the JAC walker (or similar tools) are playable.

## What it checks
- **Blocking rules**:
  - Walls (expanded into full horizontal/vertical segments) and small obstacles block movement.
  - Player and enemy cells are always considered free (overlaps allowed).
- **Reachability**:
  - Every enemy must be reachable from the player using 4-directional movement.
- **Enemy count**:
  - The map must contain at least `level["num_enemies"]` enemies.
- **Bounds**:
  - Player and enemy positions must be inside the grid.
