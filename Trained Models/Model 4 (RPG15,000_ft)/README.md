# RPG Level Generator — Fine‑Tuned Model (15,000‑row dataset)

**Project goal:** Generate playable, progressively challenging RPG maps as compact JSON/ASCII grids.  
**Model:** locally fine‑tuned causal LM on **15,000** curated level records, with **GPT‑4o‑mini fallback** for extended depth beyond L5–L6.

## TL;DR

- Trained on **15k rows**, producing **stable, consistent** maps up to **Level 5**, with **occasional Level 6**.  
- **Slightly improved** structure and **creativity** vs. the **10k** model; levels feel **more RPG‑like**.  
- **Progression** is **smooth** and **coherent** through L5; deeper levels remain challenging.  
- **Fallback to GPT‑4o‑mini** is used around **L5–L6** for extended progression.

## 🎯 Performance Summary

| Capability | What you can expect |
|---|---|
| Level coverage | Stable L1–L5 locally; sometimes L6; fallback after L5–L6 |
| Structure quality | Improved vs. 10k; better structure and moderate creativity |
| Stability | Strong through L5; fewer abrupt terminations |
| Variety | Better than 10k, but some repetition persists |
| Progression | Smooth and coherent through L5; deeper levels are harder |

## 🔎 Observations

- Larger dataset **improves diversity** and **reduces repetition**.  
- Levels are **more “RPG‑like”** with better **structural flow** and **consistency**.  
- **Progression stability** is strong until **Level 5**; deeper levels are still challenging.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Still falls back around **Level 5–6**, not sustaining higher‑level generation natively.  
- **Creativity** improved, but not dramatically — maps are **functional**, not highly **innovative**.  
- **Some structural repetition** remains despite dataset growth.

---


**Policy:** Use the **local model for L1–L5 (sometimes L6)**; **fallback** beyond **L5–L6** or on **validation failure**.
