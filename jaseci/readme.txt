# ðŸ§© Jac Module

This folder contains the **Jac-specific components** for the project **Auto-Adaptive Fine-tuning for Jac MTLLM using RPG Game Generation**.  
It is the core part that integrates **Jac language programs**, the **web UI**, and the **backend server**.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Start the backend server
Navigate to the server folder and run:

cd server
conda activate <your environment>
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000       

This will launch the API endpoints (e.g., /api/shutdown, /api/start, etc.).

### 1. Run the web interface
